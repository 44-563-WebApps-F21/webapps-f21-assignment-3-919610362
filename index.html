<blockquote cite="https://brilliant.org/wiki/convex-hull/"> The convex hull is a ubiquitous structure in computational geometry. Even though it is a useful tool in its own right, it is also helpful in constructing other structures like Voronoi diagrams, and in applications like unsupervised image analysis.</blockquote>
