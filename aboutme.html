    I was born in an universe where everyone can gain superpowers. However, I was born with no superpowers. My superpower was passed down from a top-ranked super hero. In an unfortunate scenario, he granted this power. My superpower is the ability to summon super strength when I want it or when I'm in a perilous position. I can travel more quickly and teleport to any location I desire. However, there were several powers buried within me that were eventually revealed. With black structures sprouting from my body, I can halt any form of object.
